# xero-python-oauth-starter

This is a starter app with the code to perform OAuth 2.0 authentication

You'll be able to connect to a Xero Organisation and make real API calls - we recommend you connect to the Demo company.
Please use your Demo Company organisation for your testing. 
[Here](https://central.xero.com/s/article/Use-the-demo-company) is how to turn it on.

## Getting Started

### Prerequirements
* python3.5+ installed
* git installed
* SSH keys setup for your github profile.

### Download the code
* Clone this repo to your local drive.

### Local installation
* Open terminal window and navigate to your `xero-python-oauth2-starter` local drive directory 
* Create new python virtual environment by running `python3 -m venv venv`
* Activate new virtual environment by running `source venv/bin/activate` Windows users need to use `venv\scripts\activate.ps1`
* Install project dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Create a Xero App
To obtain your API keys, follow these steps and create a Xero app

* Create a [free Xero user account](https://www.xero.com/us/signup/api/) (if you don't have one)
* Login to [Xero developer center](https://developer.xero.com/myapps)
* Click "New App" link
* Enter your App name, company url, privacy policy url.
* Enter the redirect URI (your callback url - i.e. `http://localhost:5000/callback`)
    * Be aware `http://localhost/` and `http:/127.0.0.1/` are different urls
* Agree to terms and condition and click "Create App".
* Click "Generate a secret" button.
* Copy your client id and client secret and save for use later.
* Click the "Save" button. You secret is now hidden.

## Configure API keys
* Create a `config.py` file in the root directory of this project & add the 2 variables
```python
CLIENT_ID = "...client id string..."
CLIENT_SECRET = "...client secret string..."
```

## Take it for a spin

* Make sure your python virtual environment activated `source venv/bin/activate`
* Start flask application `python3 app.py`
* Launch your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000/login 
* You should be redirected to Xero login page.
* Grant access to your user account and select the Demo company to connect to.
* Done - try out the different API calls

### This starter app functions include:

* connect & reconnect to xero
* storing Xero token in a permanent flask session (in local drive file)
* refresh Xero access token on expiry  (happens automatically)
* read organisation information from /organisation endpoint
* read invoices information from /invoices endpoint
* create a new contact in Xero
